I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a strong focus on real-time embedded system software, PCB design (AutoCAD), and system testing. My technical experience spans debugging, prototyping, fabrication, and hardware validation. Alongside these engineering skills, I bring a solid foundation in teamwork, communication, time management, and adaptability — qualities I developed and sharpened while working in fast-paced restaurant environments during my collegiate career.

                <h3>My Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Jacksonville, FL, and like many kids born in the 2000s, I grew up surrounded by technology that was still finding
                    its footing. My first real introduction came through school, where I took a class on HTML, and outside of that I was an avid gamer. I loved
                    technology, but for a long time I never thought to ask <em>how</em> things worked — that curiosity came later and ultimately pushed me toward
                    engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I started college at UCF, I wasn’t sure where I was headed. My first major was Architecture, chosen partly from a childhood love of
                    building with Legos. At the same time, I was working at a hospital, balancing school and a job while finishing my general education courses.
                    I didn’t yet have a clear direction, but engineering was always in the back of my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A turning point came after a hard but honest conversation with a family member and mentor, who reminded me that growth comes from challenge,
                    not comfort. I changed my major to Computer Engineering and started taking courses that felt both fun and meaningful. That’s when things
                    clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To support myself, I also worked at a small used car dealership in Orlando, servicing vehicles and solving whatever problems came through
                    the door. It was there that I made the connection between my coursework and the real world. As I dug deeper into the electrical systems of
                    cars, I began to recognize embedded systems in action — technology I was studying in class applied directly to the vehicles I was repairing.
                    That connection sparked a passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I’ve developed an eagerness to keep learning and a drive to stay informed. Engineering has become more than just a major — it’s
                    something I want to pursue as a lifelong career. With graduation expected in Spring 2026, I’m excited to continue building on this
                    foundation, working alongside experienced engineers, and contributing to projects that bring technology to life.
